# RUNBOOK — HierarchicalDet reproduction on Kaggle

Everything needed to go from a fresh Kaggle account to a populated
`paper_assets/`. Read the whole of §1 before starting: the session limits shape
every decision below.

---

## 1. Kaggle execution model

| Constraint | Value | Consequence for this suite |
|---|---|---|
| Accelerators | P100 16 GB, or **T4 x2** (preferred) | Swin-B at `IMS_PER_BATCH=1` per GPU with AMP fits 16 GB. Batch 2 on one T4 OOMs — measured, not assumed. |
| GPU quota | ~30 GPU-hours/week | `micro` (the default) is engineered to fit in ~13 h, so a full pass plus re-runs fits one week. |
| Session limit | 12 h | Every training run is budgeted to ≤11 h and is resumable; nothing assumes it finishes in one sitting. |
| CPU sessions | quota-free | Notebook 01 and the CPU pass of notebook 03 cost no GPU quota at all. |
| `/kaggle/working` | ~20 GB, persists within a session; saved by "Save Version" | Checkpoints are pruned to `last` + `best` + trajectory snapshots. Archives are deleted as soon as they are extracted. |
| Internet | must be enabled in notebook Settings | Required for the HuggingFace download, the Swin-B weights, and `pip`. |
| GPU access | requires **phone verification** | Do this before you plan a session. |

**Before running any notebook:** Settings → Internet = *On*; Settings →
Persistence = *Variables and files*. Accelerator is per notebook — see §3.

### Multi-GPU

Notebook 02 probes `launch(num_gpus=2)` with a real 20-iteration run before
committing any quota. If DDP fails in the session, it **falls back to one GPU
automatically** and writes the fallback into `paper_assets/deviations.md`. Do
not fight a flaky DDP setup; the fallback is the supported path, and the batch
size it implies is recorded.

### Persistence between sessions

State moves between sessions through **Kaggle Datasets**. Both are produced by
the notebooks themselves — nothing has to be sourced or uploaded by hand.

* `dentex-repro-data` — `/kaggle/working/dentex_converted/`: the converted COCO
  files and verified images, written by notebook 01. Training never re-downloads
  from HuggingFace.
* `dentex-repro-ckpts` — `/kaggle/working/runs/`: checkpoints, prediction dumps,
  calibration and run records, written by notebook 02.

Both also carry `paper_assets/` (the accumulated `results_raw/`, `manifest.json`
and `deviations.md`). That directory lives inside the *cloned repo*, so a fresh
session would otherwise re-clone it empty and lose every prior result;
`setup_env.bootstrap` restores it from any attached dataset at startup, never
overwriting a file the current session has already produced.

Publishing is automated with the `kaggle` CLI using `KAGGLE_USERNAME` /
`KAGGLE_KEY` from **Add-ons → Secrets**. Credentials are never written to disk
or into a notebook.

**Manual fallback** (if the CLI is unavailable or the secrets are not set):
*Save Version → Save & Run All*, then on the next notebook *Add Data → Your
Work →* select that output. `src.train_utils.seed_from_attached_datasets`
searches every mounted `/kaggle/input/*` for the newest checkpoint of a run, so
the layout inside the attached dataset does not have to match exactly.

---

## 2. Run modes

One switch, set in the parameter cell of every notebook.

| mode | schedule | total GPU-h | what runs |
|---|---|---|---|
| `smoke` | 200 iters/run, 20-image evals | ~0.6 | **every experiment class**, including base DiffusionDet and all four variants. Proves the chain end to end. |
| `micro` *(default)* | hour-capped: quadrant 1.75 h, enumeration 1.75 h, each diagnosis variant 2.75 h | ~13 | 5 training runs. Base DiffusionDet and variant `wo_manip_transfer` are skipped. |
| `budget` | 15k / 15k / 20k iterations | ~30 | full matrix at half the paper's schedules. |
| `full` | 30k / 30k / 40k — the repo's own | ~60 | paper-fidelity, all three base-DiffusionDet tiers. |

### Measured throughput, and what it costs

On Kaggle **T4 x2** with the released settings (Swin-B, 1000 proposals, batch 2
= 1 per GPU, AMP), a real run measured **9.13 s/iteration** at 13.9 GB peak
of 16 GB. Everything below follows from that number:

| stage | budget | iterations you actually get |
|---|---|---|
| quadrant | 1.75 h | ~600 |
| enumeration | 1.75 h | ~600 |
| each diagnosis variant | 2.75 h | ~900 |

Against the paper's 30k / 30k / 40k, `micro` trains at roughly **2% of the
original schedule**. That is a real limitation and the reason the
checkpoint-trajectory analysis exists: it tests directly whether the ablation
ordering is stable across training progress, turning the compute constraint
into a result rather than only a caveat. Absolute AP will land well below the
paper's; the *comparison between variants*, at matched budgets, is what this
run mode buys.

### How the hour cap holds

`micro` does not guess an iteration count. Notebook 02 trains for a fixed
**5 minutes of wall clock**, discards 5 warm-up iterations, measures it/s, and
converts each hour budget into `MAX_ITER = remaining_seconds × measured_rate`,
rounded down to a multiple of 300 (so the 1/3 and 2/3 trajectory snapshots land
on whole iterations). A `TimeBudgetHook` enforces the wall-clock cap regardless,
saving `model_final.pth` if it fires. On slower hardware you get fewer
iterations, never more hours.

The probe is time-bounded rather than iteration-bounded for a measured reason:
a fixed 500-iteration probe costs 76 minutes at 9.13 s/iter — 72% of the whole
quadrant budget — and would have left that stage just 300 iterations. The
probe is also charged to the budget exactly once for the whole study, not once
per stage.

The measurement is cached and shared, so **all three diagnosis variants get the
same `MAX_ITER`** — their budgets are identical by construction, not
approximately equal. `train_utils.assert_matched_budgets` aborts the run if they
ever diverge; an ablation at unmatched budgets is not an ablation.

## 3. Order of execution — three notebooks

The split is on the only two boundaries that matter on Kaggle: **what
accelerator a session needs**, and **what fits in one session**. Anything finer
would only add cross-notebook state to lose.

| # | Notebook | Accelerator | Attach | Wall time (`micro`) | Produces |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `01_setup_and_data` | **None** (CPU, free) | — | ~50 min | pinned env + vendored-import proof, converted COCO, audit table, GT figure, clean/stress subsets → `dentex-repro-data` |
| 2 | `02_train_all` | **T4 x2** | data (+ ckpts on re-runs) | ~11 h, **across sessions** (smoke: ~1.5 h) | DDP verdict, pre-flight smoke, calibration, quadrant + enumeration, noisy-box dumps, all diagnosis variants + trajectory snapshots, base DiffusionDet → `dentex-repro-ckpts` |
| 3 | `03_evaluate_and_build_assets` | **T4**, then **None** | data, ckpts | ~2.5 h on GPU, ~5 min on CPU | all metrics × 3 seeds, trajectory sweep, step sweep, degradation grid, clean/stress, fault injection, error analysis, qualitative figures, and every file in `paper_assets/` |
| opt | `opt_baselines_and_simmim` | T4 | data | ~1 GPU-h per baseline; 10+ h for SimMIM | baseline rows; closes the pretraining deviation |

### The two things to know

**Notebook 02 will not finish in one session, and that is the design.** `micro`
needs ~12.25 GPU-h against a 12 h limit. Every run checkpoints every 2,500
iterations, is skipped once complete, and resumes from its last checkpoint
otherwise. Re-run the same notebook in a fresh session with `dentex-repro-ckpts`
attached until it reaches the end. Expect 2 sessions.

**Notebook 03 adapts to whatever accelerator it gets.** On a **T4** it runs
every GPU experiment and then builds the assets. On **Accelerator = None** it
skips the GPU sections, measures CPU-only inference (quota-free), and rebuilds
every table, figure and document from `paper_assets/results_raw/`. So run it
once on GPU, then once on CPU — the CPU pass adds the CPU benchmark and the
CPU-vs-GPU agreement check. After that, any CPU run regenerates every asset in
minutes without touching the quota.

### Smoke first

Set `RUN_MODE = "smoke"` and run 01 → 02 → 03. Budget about **1.5 GPU-h for
notebook 02** and ~0.5 h for notebook 03 — at 9.13 s/iter a 200-iteration stage
is ~30 min, and there are seven of them plus the prediction dumps. It exercises
every experiment class end to end. Only then switch to `micro`.

Run outputs and raw results are **scoped by run mode** (`runs/<mode>/`,
`results_raw/<mode>/`). Without that, a finished 200-iteration smoke checkpoint
would make the real `micro` run skip training entirely and silently build the
paper out of smoke-mode models.

---

## 4. Scope cuts in `micro`, and what they cost the paper

These are deliberate, and each is written to `paper_assets/deviations.md` by the
notebook that made it.

1. **Variant 4 (`w/o Manipulation & Transfer`) is not trained.**
   Cost: the paper's "neither component" row carries the original's numbers as
   cited-untested context. Variants 1–3 still give both single-switch contrasts,
   which is what the central claim — *manipulation contributes the gain,
   transfer alone does not* — actually rests on.
2. **Base DiffusionDet is not trained.**
   Cost: the "does the hierarchy beat plain DiffusionDet?" comparison is
   untested in `micro`. Run `budget` or `full` to recover it — its budget is
   independent of the variants, so re-running notebook 02 in `budget` will train
   it and skip everything already finished.
3. **Baselines (RetinaNet / Faster R-CNN / DETR) are optional.**
   Cost: three baseline rows stay cited-untested.
4. **SimMIM pretraining is skipped in every mode by default.**
   The authors' checkpoint is not public and the code lives in another
   repository. Our models start from a backbone that has never seen a panoramic
   radiograph, which confounds any accuracy gap against the paper. Notebook
   opt-11 closes it if you have the quota.

The compute constraint is also turned into a *result*: every diagnosis variant
is evaluated at ~1/3, ~2/3 and 1/1 of its budget. If the variant ordering is
stable across those checkpoints, the ablation conclusion is not an artifact of
the shortened schedule; if it is unstable, that is a reportable finding about
how budget-sensitive the paper's claim is. Notebook 03 prints the verdict and
writes it to the summary.

---

## 5. Things that will bite you

* **The notebook cells do not update with `git pull`.** The parameter cell
  refreshes `src/` and `configs_repro/` from GitHub, but the cells themselves
  are the copy uploaded to Kaggle. A session was observed running `src/` three
  commits ahead of its own cells — using a superseded DDP probe and a pre-flight
  four times longer than intended, silently. Every notebook now carries a build
  fingerprint checked against the repo, so a stale copy fails immediately with
  instructions. **When told the notebook is stale: File → Import Notebook and
  re-upload it from `notebooks/`.**

* **Never `pip install detectron2`.** The repo vendors a *modified* detectron2
  and pycocotools (multi-label partial annotations, a 3-tier category schema).
  A pip install silently shadows them and every number changes.
  `setup_env.assert_vendored()` raises on this; it runs in every notebook.
* **The Swin backbone must be a `.pth`.** `DetectionCheckpointer` dispatches on
  file extension: a torch checkpoint named `.pkl` is parsed as a Caffe2 blob and
  the backbone stays random, reported only as warnings. The released config's
  `models/swin_base_patch4_window7_224_22k.pkl` is exactly this trap.
* **`configs/diffdet.custom.swinbase.enumeration.yaml` cannot run.** It sets
  `NUM_CLASSES: 32` as a scalar; `hierarchialdet/head.py:81` indexes that value
  as a 3-element list. Use `configs_repro/` instead.
* **Do not run the training loop in the notebook kernel.** Training goes through
  `src/train_entry.py` as a subprocess so a CUDA OOM or a session kill leaves a
  resumable checkpoint instead of a wedged kernel.
* **A stale `NOISY_BOX_TRAIN` turns the "w/o Manipulation" variant back into the
  full model.** `launch_training` explicitly *unsets* every noisy-box variable
  that was not requested for that run.
* **Disk.** `training_data.zip` alone is 10.9 GB. Notebook 01 downloads one
  archive at a time and deletes each one as soon as it is extracted; do not
  "helpfully" pre-download everything with `snapshot_download`.

---

## 6. Verifying a finished run

```python
from src import manifest
manifest.assert_asset_classes()      # every required asset class accounted for
```

Nothing may be cited in the paper that is not in `paper_assets/manifest.json`.
Asset classes an active run mode deliberately skipped are recorded with
`status="not run"` — that counts as accounted for, and the corresponding table
cells read `not run`. **No number anywhere in `paper_assets/` is interpolated,
extrapolated, or carried over from another run mode.**

`status="not run"` also covers an asset that *was* produced in an earlier
session but whose output file did not carry into this one (see the
`_not_run_*.txt` markers under `paper_assets/tables/` and `figures/` and
their `note` field in the manifest) — this is indistinguishable from "never
run" to a reader unless the note is checked. Before treating any conclusion
in the paper as settled, confirm the asset it cites is actually present, not
just cited.

`table:dataset_audit` in particular carries the per-tier class histograms
that back the Deep Caries test-split finding, and previously depended on
notebook 01 running in the *same* session as notebook 03 — it was only ever
built from the in-memory `audits` dict, so a standalone notebook 03 rebuild
silently dropped it even though notebook 01's `summary_01_setup_and_data.json`
(under `results_raw/<mode>/`) already retained everything needed to
reconstruct it. Notebook 03 now falls back to that retained summary the same
way the Runs table falls back to retained run records, so the table survives
a standalone rebuild — it only reads as `not run` now if notebook 01 has
never been run at all for this run mode.

## 7. Re-verifying without retraining

A reviewer with the two published Kaggle Datasets attached runs one notebook:

```
notebooks/03_evaluate_and_build_assets.ipynb   →   Accelerator: GPU T4   →   Run All
```

That reproduces every value in `tables/main_results.csv` from the released
checkpoints. Re-running the same notebook on a CPU session rebuilds every table
and figure for free. The exact instructions, with the dataset slugs used for the run, are
regenerated into `paper_assets/scope_and_claims.md`.

---

*All outputs of this suite are research artifacts. Nothing here is a clinical
claim, and nothing here is validated for clinical use.*

---

## 8. Known failure modes and their fixes

**`ValueError: numpy.dtype size changed, Expected 96 ... got 88`**, raised from
`pycocotools/_mask.pyx` inside `detectron2.structures.masks`. This reads as a
detectron2 problem and is not one: the vendored `pycocotools` ships Python
sources only, and its compiled `_mask` extension is grafted in from the
pip-installed package. That extension is compiled against numpy's C ABI, so it
breaks if it was built against a different numpy major version than the one
installed. Pinning a `pycocotools` version *causes* this, because pip then
builds from source in an isolated environment that pulls the newest numpy
regardless of what the image has.

`setup_env.ensure_pycocotools_mask` now owns this end to end: it verifies the
extension by importing it in a subprocess, discards a mismatched one, tries each
candidate in site-packages, and only as a last resort rebuilds with
`--no-build-isolation --no-binary :all:` so the build sees the installed numpy.
If it still cannot, it raises with the exact command to run by hand.
